# GC-Skew-Plotter
This repository contains a simple Python script for plotting the G-C skew of a DNA sequence. G-C skew is a measure of the nucleotide composition imbalances between guanine (G) and cytosine (C) in a DNA sequence, often used to identify key genomic regions.  
The circular chromosomes of bacteria start replication from a specific point called the origin of replication (ori) and proceed in two directions until reaching the replication terminus (ter). The replication process involves different methods for the leading and lagging strands.

The leading strand is built continuously from the 5' to 3' end, while the lagging strand is synthesized by creating small Okazaki DNA fragments that are later added to the growing strand in the 3' to 5' direction.

These distinct replication processes result in mutational biases. The DNA polymerase replicating the leading strand has a higher chance of cytosine deamination, leading to C→T mutations. Replication mechanisms for the lagging strand have a higher chance of repairing the same C→T mutation.

This difference in replication creates a GC skew, where the leading strand has more Gs than Cs, and the lagging strand has more Cs than Gs. Quantitative measurements of GC skew are calculated using the formula (G-C)/(G+C) in fixed-size windows along the genome.

GC skew plots, generated by calculating GC skew in adjacent or overlapping windows, show distinct patterns in bacterial genomes. Leading strands typically have positive GC skew, while lagging strands have negative GC skew.

        lines = file.readlines()[1:]
        dna_sequence = ''.join([line.strip() for line in lines])

The GC skew effect is strong enough to help identify the ori/ter locations within a few kilobases. Cumulative skew diagrams provide a comprehensive view, with the origin associated with a global minimum and the terminus with a global maximum. In simpler terms, the lowest point in the cumulative skew diagram marks the origin of replication, while the highest point corresponds to the terminus.
